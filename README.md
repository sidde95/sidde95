<h2> Hi, I'm Siddharth!</h2>

<h3>Why read me?</h3><br>
  I'm writing this in the hope that we can fast forward through some getting to know you facets of me that we might miss.
  I am erally keen to do great work with/for you and I can be extremely extraordinary creative and productive under the right conditions. I also love learning, brainstorming and ofcourse I am best at taking short naps. I can be extremely extraordinary creative and productive under the right conditions.
  I am also very imperfect and I hope that my transparency about them here is not treated as an excuse for my flaws but as a guide for you to know how I might fail. Consider this an open invite for you to call me out and prevent bigger pain down the road!
  
<h3>My role</h3>

I work as a Business Analyst at Relatient, a software developer serving its product in US Healthcare Domain helping patients to schedule hassle free interface to schedule their appointments in a more simplified ways.


<h3>What I believe the most</h3>
<ul>
  1. <b>Learn in Public</b>: I prefere to share what I learn and work on, after doing my level best before it's perfect. This means I will be wrong more oftern than most people, but I respond very well to people who correct me because I always reserve the right to be wrong.
  
  2. <b>Systme over Goals</b>: There are things I can control🎮and things I can't😅. Of the things I can control I focus on the items I can work on more frequently that can compound, and get me tangibly closer toward my itendified goal. But the goal isn't the point. The goal doesn't matter at. What matters?, it is the system that sustainably gets me there that is everything, and I welcome the opportunity to periodically take a step back and work on the system instead of working in the system.
  
  3. <b>Maintaining a hooby to relax myself</b>: There are many things which I want to create or maintain but can't fufill all of those due to time contraint. How to get more than 24 hours a day?🤯😂, well I prefer driving mostly in the rural areas with soft music in background and not thinking about any of goals, responsibilty instead just concentratating on the scenic beauty and enjoying the hasslefree and technology independent lifestyle of the rual people, which chanting the lyrics🌝.
